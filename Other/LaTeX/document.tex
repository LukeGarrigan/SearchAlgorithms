\maketitle
When you write a
paragraph with \LaTeX{} you do not need to
bother about the formatting. \LaTeX{} will
take care of it.

% new paragraph when one or more blank lines

When \LaTeX{} encounters a blank line
the current paragraph finishes.
Next time it finds some text it starts a new paragraph.

List of things to do:\\
Learn \LaTeX, practice with \LaTeX ,
become a \LaTeX{}pert,
write a book on \LaTeX ,
bore the pants of students with \LaTeX.

I am 100\% sure you’ll have no problem
using \LaTeX{} \ldots{} I am prepared to bet
1\pounds on it (I am not mad!).
